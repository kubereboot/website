```

## Reboot Sentinel File & Period

By default kured checks for the existence of
`/var/run/reboot-required` every sixty minutes; you can override these
values with `--reboot-sentinel` and `--period`. Each replica of the
daemon uses a random offset derived from the period on startup so that
nodes don't all contend for the lock simultaneously.

## Reboot Sentinel Command

Alternatively, a reboot sentinel command can be used. If a reboot
sentinel command is used, the reboot sentinel file presence will be
ignored. When the command exits with code `0`, kured will assume
that a reboot is required.

For example, if you're using RHEL or its derivatives, you can
set the sentinel command to `sh -c "! needs-restarting --reboothint"`
(by default the command will return `1` if a reboot is required,
so we wrap it in `sh -c` and add `!` to negate the return value).

```yaml
configuration:
  rebootSentinelCommand: sh -c "! needs-restarting --reboothint"
```

## Setting a schedule

By default, kured will reboot any time it detects the sentinel, but this
may cause reboots during odd hours.  While service disruption does not
normally occur, anything is possible and operators may want to restrict
reboots to predictable schedules.  Use `--reboot-days`, `--start-time`,
`--end-time`, and `--time-zone` to set a schedule.  For example, business
hours on the west coast USA can be specified with:

```console
  --reboot-days=mon,tue,wed,thu,fri
  --start-time=9am
  --end-time=5pm
  --time-zone=America/Los_Angeles
```

Times can be formatted in numerous ways, including `5pm`, `5:00pm` `17:00`,
and `17`.  `--time-zone` represents a Go `time.Location`, and can be `UTC`,
`Local`, or any entry in the standard Linux tz database.

Note that when using smaller time windows, you should consider shortening
the sentinel check period (`--period`).

## Blocking Reboots via Alerts

You may find it desirable to block automatic node reboots when there
are active alerts - you can do so by providing the URL of your
Prometheus server:

```console
--prometheus-url=http://prometheus.monitoring.svc.cluster.local
```

By default the presence of *any* active (pending or firing) alerts
will block reboots, however you can ignore specific alerts:

```console
--alert-filter-regexp=^(RebootRequired|AnotherBenignAlert|...$
```

You can also only block reboots for firing alerts:

```console
--alert-firing-only=true
```

When inverting the matching-logic, only matching alerts can block a reboot:

```console
--alert-filter-match-only=true
```

See the section on Prometheus metrics for an important application of this
filter.

## Blocking Reboots via Pods

You can also block reboots of an *individual node* when specific pods
are scheduled on it:

```console
--blocking-pod-selector=runtime=long,cost=expensive
```

Since label selector strings use commas to express logical 'and', you can
specify this parameter multiple times for 'or':

```console
--blocking-pod-selector=runtime=long,cost=expensive
--blocking-pod-selector=name=temperamental
```

In this case, the presence of either an (appropriately labelled) expensive long
running job or a known temperamental pod on a node will stop it rebooting.

> Try not to abuse this mechanism - it's better to strive for
> restartability where possible. If you do use it, make sure you set
> up a RebootRequired alert as described in the next section so that
> you can intervene manually if reboots are blocked for too long.

## Adding node labels before and after reboots

If you need to add node labels before and after the reboot process, you can use `--pre-reboot-node-labels` and `--post-reboot-node-labels`:

```console
      --pre-reboot-node-labels=zalando=notready
      --post-reboot-node-labels=zalando=ready
```

Labels can be comma-delimited (e.g. `--pre-reboot-node-labels=zalando=notready,thisnode=disabled`) or you can supply the flags multiple times.

Note that label keys specified by these two flags should match. If they do not match, a warning will be generated.

## Prometheus Metrics

Each kured pod exposes a single gauge metric (`:8080/metrics`) that
indicates the presence of the sentinel file:

```console
# HELP kured_reboot_required OS requires reboot due to software updates.
# TYPE kured_reboot_required gauge
kured_reboot_required{node="ip-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.ec2.internal"} 0
```

Note: Use `--metrics-host` and/or `--metrics-port` to set a different address
where metrics should listen. The values of these flags will be put together
like "<host>:<port>" to define a complete listen address for the metrics
server.

The purpose of this metric is to power an alert which will summon an
operator if the cluster cannot reboot itself automatically for a
prolonged period:

```console
# Alert if a reboot is required for any machines. Acts as a failsafe for the
# reboot daemon, which will not reboot nodes if there are pending alerts save
# this one.
ALERT RebootRequired
  IF          max(kured_reboot_required) != 0
  FOR         24h
  LABELS      { severity="warning" }
  ANNOTATIONS {
    summary = "Machine(s) require being rebooted, and the reboot daemon has failed to do so for 24 hours",
    impact = "Cluster nodes more vulnerable to security exploits. Eventually, no disk space left.",
    description = "Machine(s) require being rebooted, probably due to kernel update.",
  }
```

If you choose to employ such an alert and have configured kured to
probe for active alerts before rebooting, be sure to specify
`--alert-filter-regexp=^RebootRequired$` to avoid deadlock!

## Notifications

When you specify a formatted URL using `--notify-url`, kured will notify
about draining and rebooting nodes across a list of technologies.

![Notification](/img/slack-notification.png)

Alternatively you can use the `--message-template-drain`, `--message-template-reboot` and `--message-template-uncordon` to customize the text of the message, e.g.

```cli
--message-template-drain="Draining node %s part of *my-cluster* in region *xyz*"
```

Here is the syntax:

- slack:           `slack://tokenA/tokenB/tokenC`

    (`slack://<USERNAME>@tokenA/tokenB/tokenC` - in case you want to [respect username](https://github.com/kubereboot/kured/issues/482))

    (`--slack-hook-url` is deprecated but possible to use)

  For the new slack App integration, use:\
    `slack://xoxb:123456789012-1234567890123-4mt0t4l1YL3g1T5L4cK70k3N@<CHANNEL_NAME>?botname=<BOTNAME>`\

## Overriding Lock Configuration

The `--ds-name` and `--ds-namespace` arguments should match the name and
namespace of the daemonset used to deploy the reboot daemon - the locking is
implemented by means of an annotation on this resource. The defaults match
the daemonset YAML provided in the repository.

Similarly `--lock-annotation` can be used to change the name of the
annotation kured will use to store the lock, but the default is almost
certainly safe.

## Concurrent reboots

> Note: Concurrent reboots are not save for production environments as
> there are no safeguards related to workloads on simultaneously rebooted nodes.

The `--concurrency` argument can be configured to reboot multiple nodes at once.
E.g. with `--concurrency=3` it would be allowed to reboot three nodes concurrently on max.
This is useful for development clusters where interruptions of workloads are okay.
